Network penetration testing, often referred to as network pentesting or ethical hacking, is a critical discipline within cybersecurity that focuses on assessing the security of computer networks. 
The primary goal of network pentesting is to identify weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and potential entry points that malicious actors could exploit to compromise a network's integrity, availability, or confidentiality.


## Networking Essentials

- OSI Model: Understanding the layered architecture helps in pinpointing vulnerabilities at various levels.
- Protocols: In-depth knowledge of TCP/IP and other network protocols is essential for accurate analysis.
- Subnetting and IP Addressing: Subnetting knowledge aids in identifying network segments and potential entry points.
