| OSI Layer | Layer Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 7         | Application Layer           | Responsible for providing network services directly to end-users or applications. It includes protocols for tasks like file transfer, email, remote access, and more.                                                        |
| 6         | Presentation Layer          | Focuses on data translation, encryption, and compression to ensure data is presented in a usable format. It deals with formatting, encryption, and data compression for efficient transmission.                                |
| 5         | Session Layer               | Manages and maintains communication sessions between devices. It establishes, manages, and terminates connections, allowing data exchange in an organized and synchronized manner.                                     |
| 4         | Transport Layer             | Manages end-to-end communication and ensures data delivery with error detection and correction. It breaks down larger messages into smaller segments and handles sequencing and flow control.                                |
| 3         | Network Layer               | Responsible for routing data between different networks. It determines the optimal path for data packets to travel from source to destination and handles logical addressing and subnetting.                              |
| 2         | Data Link Layer             | Focuses on reliable point-to-point communication within a network segment. It encapsulates data into frames, handles physical addressing, error detection, and flow control, ensuring data link reliability.                 |
| 1         | Physical Layer              | Deals with the physical medium of communication, including cables, switches, and electrical signals. It defines the hardware and transmission methods needed to transmit raw bits over a physical medium.                    |
