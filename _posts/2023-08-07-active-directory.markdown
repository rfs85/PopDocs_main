Active Directory (AD) is a centralized directory service developed by Microsoft, widely used by organizations to manage and control access to network resources. 
It plays a pivotal role in maintaining user accounts, authentication, authorization, and network configurations in Windows-based environments. 
For a penetration tester, AD presents a unique challenge and opportunity to uncover vulnerabilities that can lead to unauthorized access and data compromise.

## Active Directory Enumeration
One of the initial steps in assessing an AD environment is enumeration, the process of gathering information about users, groups, computers, and network configurations. Enumeration provides valuable insights that help you identify potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities.

### Initial Access Techniques


### Enumeration Techniques
