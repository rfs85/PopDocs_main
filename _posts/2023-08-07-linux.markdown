Linux is a popular and powerful choice for penetration testers and ethical hackers due to its flexibility, customization options, and a wide range of security tools available. Here are a few Linux distributions (distros) specifically designed for penetration testing and ethical hacking purposes:

## Networking Essentials

- OSI Model: Understanding the layered architecture helps in pinpointing vulnerabilities at various levels.
- Protocols: In-depth knowledge of TCP/IP and other network protocols is essential for accurate analysis.
- Subnetting and IP Addressing: Subnetting knowledge aids in identifying network segments and potential entry points.

  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">&times;</button>
  <h4>Warning!</h4>
  <p>Best check yo self, you're not looking too good. Nulla vitae elit libero, a pharetra augue. Praesent commodo cursus magna, <a href="#" class="alert-link">vel scelerisque nisl consectetur et</a>.</p>
</div>

## Ethical Guidelines

- Permission: Always obtain written consent from the organization before initiating any pentesting activities.
- Scope: Define the scope of testing, outlining the assets and areas that can be assessed.
- Reporting: Document all findings accurately and promptly, assisting the organization in addressing vulnerabilities.
