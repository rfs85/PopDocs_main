## Networking Basics
Networking basics involve understanding how devices such as computers, routers, switches, and servers communicate and share information within a network. 

This includes comprehending the fundamental concepts like IP addresses, which uniquely identify devices on a network, and subnetting, which segments large networks into smaller, manageable parts. 

Additionally, knowledge of protocols like TCP/IP, which govern data exchange across networks, and the OSI model, which categorizes network functions into distinct layers, is essential. 

Understanding concepts such as LANs (Local Area Networks) and WANs (Wide Area Networks), as well as grasping the significance of routing, switching, and firewalls in directing and securing data traffic, forms the core of networking basics. 

This foundation is pivotal for various roles, including network administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and penetration testers, as it underpins effective communication and safeguards against potential threats in the digital realm.

| OSI Layer | Layer Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 7         | Application Layer           | Responsible for providing network services directly to end-users or applications. It includes protocols for tasks like file transfer, email, remote access, and more.                                                        |
| 6         | Presentation Layer          | Focuses on data translation, encryption, and compression to ensure data is presented in a usable format. It deals with formatting, encryption, and data compression for efficient transmission.                                |
| 5         | Session Layer               | Manages and maintains communication sessions between devices. It establishes, manages, and terminates connections, allowing data exchange in an organized and synchronized manner.                                     |
| 4         | Transport Layer             | Manages end-to-end communication and ensures data delivery with error detection and correction. It breaks down larger messages into smaller segments and handles sequencing and flow control.                                |
| 3         | Network Layer               | Responsible for routing data between different networks. It determines the optimal path for data packets to travel from source to destination and handles logical addressing and subnetting.                              |
| 2         | Data Link Layer             | Focuses on reliable point-to-point communication within a network segment. It encapsulates data into frames, handles physical addressing, error detection, and flow control, ensuring data link reliability.                 |
| 1         | Physical Layer              | Deals with the physical medium of communication, including cables, switches, and electrical signals. It defines the hardware and transmission methods needed to transmit raw bits over a physical medium.                    |

## Networking Devices
- Router: Connects multiple networks together and forwards data packets between them.
- Switch: Connects devices within a local network, making data forwarding more efficient than traditional hubs.
- Hub: Connects devices in a network, but unlike switches, it broadcasts data to all connected devices.
- Access Point (AP): Provides wireless connectivity to devices, acting as a bridge between wired and wireless networks.
- Modem: Converts digital data from a computer into analog signals for transmission over telephone or cable lines, and vice versa.
- Firewall: A security device that filters and monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic to prevent unauthorized access and potential threats.
- Load Balancer: Distributes network traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource usage and enhance performance.
- Proxy Server: Acts as an intermediary between client devices and external servers, often used for content filtering, caching, and anonymity.
- Network Attached Storage (NAS): Specialized device for storing and sharing files within a network, often accessed via file-sharing protocols.

## Networking Topologies

Networking topologies refer to the arrangement or layout of devices and connections within a computer network. Different topologies dictate how data flows and nodes interact. 

In a star topology, devices connect to a central hub, enabling easy management but relying heavily on the hub's functionality. Bus topology involves a single communication line shared by all devices, with terminators at the ends to prevent signal reflection. 

In a ring topology, devices form a circular pathway, promoting uniform data distribution but susceptible to a single point of failure. A mesh topology offers redundancy by connecting each device to multiple others, ensuring reliability but increasing complexity. 

Hybrid topology combines two or more types, optimizing benefits while addressing drawbacks. The choice of topology depends on factors like network size, scalability, fault tolerance, and management ease.
